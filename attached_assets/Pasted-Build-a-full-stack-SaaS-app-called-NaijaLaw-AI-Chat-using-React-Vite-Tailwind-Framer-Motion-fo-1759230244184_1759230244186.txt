Build a full-stack SaaS app called NaijaLaw AI Chat using React (Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion) for the frontend, Supabase for backend/auth/database, and integrate with OpenAI API for AI responses.

Core Features (MVP - Free Tier):

Claude-like chat UI with chat sessions & memory.

Supabase Auth with role-based access (free, pro, enterprise, admin).

RAG pipeline:

Ingest/upload Nigerian legal documents (PDF, DOCX).

Parse → chunk → embed → store in Supabase.

Retrieval on query → AI answer → show citations (with clickable case metadata).

Admin dashboard: CRUD for users, subscription plans, documents, and system messages.

Paystack integration with split payments: subscription checkout, webhook handling, recurring billing, and revenue sharing.

Basic user memory: preferences, last chats, practice areas.

Pro Tier Features:

Real Internet Search (integrate Bing/SerpAPI/Tavily → merge with RAG results).

Legal Citation Generator (Nigerian case law citation style).

Case Summarizer & Headnote Generator (facts, issues, holding, ratio vs obiter).

Search by Principle/Ratio Decidendi.

Case Brief Generator (auto case briefs).

Compare Cases (side-by-side comparison).

Statute Navigator (laws, sections, amendments, cross-references).

Export & Collaboration: save chats, export to PDF/DOCX, team research boards.

Enterprise Tier Features:

Precedent Finder & Timeline (track how principles evolve, overruled cases).

Statute Evolution Tracker.

Team collaboration with role-based permissions & shared folders.

AI Drafting Assistant (motions, affidavits, arguments).

Offline Mode (PWA) with cached cases.

Voice-to-Law (speech input in English + Nigerian Pidgin).

Firm Analytics Dashboard (usage reports, research trends).

White-label option (custom hosting for firms/universities).

Database (Supabase):

users (id, name, email, password, role, subscription_id, memory JSON).

plans (id, name, tier: free/pro/enterprise, features JSON, price, split_account).

subscriptions (id, user_id, plan_id, status, start_date, end_date, paystack_ref).

documents (id, title, type, file_url, embeddings).

chats (id, user_id, session_id, message, role, sources).

UI / UX:

Modern clean look like Claude AI (centered chat, floating input box, citation cards).

Dashboard: usage stats, subscription status.

Mobile-first, responsive with Tailwind.

Seed admin user.

Add Supabase edge functions for:
